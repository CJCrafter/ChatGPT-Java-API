<!--
This template is for requesting a new feature for this API.

In general, we will not add features that are not in the OpenAI API. That
means that we try to keep the API as close to the official OpenAI APIs 
as possible except for Java-specific changes.

That being said, we are open to adding features that make this API easier
to use. 
-->

## Feature Request
<!--
Please describe the feature you would like to see added to this API.
-->

## Why?
<!--
Please describe why you would like to see this feature added to this API.

For example, if you are requesting a new method, please describe why you
would like to see this method added to the API.

For features that were are missing from the official APIs, this can just
be a link to that feature.
